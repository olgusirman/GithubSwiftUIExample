# GithubSwiftUIExample App

Welcome to the SwiftUI Example App repository! This is one of the first SwiftUI example applications created by me, showcasing basic SwiftUI components and their usage.

## Overview

This app is a simple demonstration of how to use SwiftUI to build user interfaces for iOS applications. SwiftUI is a modern framework introduced by Apple that allows developers to design and build UI in a declarative manner.

## Features

- Basic usage of SwiftUI views and modifiers
- Simple navigation between views
- Demonstrates state management using `@State` and `@Binding`
- Usage of common SwiftUI components like `Text`, `Button`, `List`, `Image`, and more

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+
- Xcode 11.0+
- Swift 5.0+
